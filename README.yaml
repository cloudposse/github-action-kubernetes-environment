# Short description of this project
description: This repository wraps the environment information action, allowing it to be used as a replacement in support of various string functions and namespace standardization.

introduction: |-
  We often find when deploying with various environments that we need to standardize the namespace names. This repository wraps the environment information action, allowing it to be used as a replacement in support of various string functions and namespace standardization.

  With this action, you can use pipe functions to standardize the namespace names, for example, to lowercase, or to replace a dash with an underscore you can use ` | kebabcase` or `| toLower`
